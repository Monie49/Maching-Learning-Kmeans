# Maching-Learning-Kmeans
K means algorithm implementation
This project is the implementation of a machine learning Algorithm Kmeans for image compression.
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining.
k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster

When running this project, three arguments need to be provided - K value, path of image for compression and path to store the compressed image.
